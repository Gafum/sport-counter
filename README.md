A modern, minimalist workout and body weight tracking application designed for simplicity and efficiency. Built with a focus on a clean, responsive user interface, it allows users to seamlessly track their fitness progress on both desktop and mobile devices. The entire application operates client-side, utilizing `localStorage` for data persistence, ensuring your data stays private and on your device.
